## Instructions

- Answer each question below using SQL executed against the **World database**.
- All SQL commands **must be run by you**.
- For each SQL-based question:
  - Include the SQL command in a fenced code block
  - Include a **screenshot** showing the command and its results
- Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each answer.

## Question 1

When importing records from `worldPGSQL.sql`, **how many cities were imported**?

### Answer

## Question 2

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **display each country name along with the name of each language spoken in that country**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT c.name AS country_name,
       cl.language AS language
FROM country c
JOIN countrylanguage cl
  ON c.code = cl.countrycode
ORDER BY c.name, cl.language;
```

## Question 4

Consider the following two SQL statements:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM country, countrylanguage
WHERE country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM country
LEFT OUTER JOIN countrylanguage
ON country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode;
```

**In your own words**, describe what data the **second query returns that the first query does not**.

### Answer
The first query does an INNER join function, so it's only returning countries that have matching rows in the countrylanguage field. The second query does a LEFT OUTER join function, so it's going to return all countries, including those that don't have matching language rows. It allows the countries that are NULL in their countrylanguage field as well.

ORDER BY governmentform;
```
