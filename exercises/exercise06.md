# Module 6 - Exercise 1: Creating a Data Warehouse
From the Operational Model to the Dimensional Model

- Name: Karli Dean
- Course: Database for Analytics
- Module: 6

## Overview

In this exercise you will design a **dimensional (star schema) model** for a data warehouse based on an **operational sales database**.

- **Business process:** Customer Sales
- **Grain:** Daily sales
- **Facts to store (only):**
  - **amount** = daily sales total amount (revenue)
  - **quantity** = daily sales total quantity (units sold)

You will determine the dimensions needed to support the required analytics.

## Operational Database Summary (Source System)

Tables in the operational model include:

- `customer` (custNumber, custName, address, currBal, credLimit, repNum)
- `parts` (partNum, partDesc, category, unitsOnHand, warehouseNum, unitPrice)
- `slsrep` (repNum, repName, repAddress, totComm, commRate)
- `orders` (orderNum, orderDate, custNum)
- `orderline` (orderNum, partNum, numOrdered)

---

## Analytics Requirements (What the Warehouse Must Support)

Your dimensional model must support questions such as:

- How many of part number **ax12** were sold on **September 2, 1994**?
- How many of part number **ax12** did customer **124** purchase last year?
- How much did customer **124** spend last year?
- What was the **average amount spent per customer per day** during September 1994?
- What was the **average quantity sold of part ax12 per day** during September 1994?
- What was the **average daily sales** during the third quarter of 1994?
- How many **appliance** items were sold during the third quarter of 1994?
- What was the amount of revenue generated by customers in **zip code 64468** during September 1994?

## Non-Requirements (Do Not Design For These)

We do **not** care about:

- Questions about **specific orders** (order-level reporting)
- Questions about **sales reps**
- Questions about **credit limits, balances**, or other customer finance fields
- Inventory questions (warehouseNum, unitsOnHand, etc.)

---

## Key Design Constraints

- The warehouse must be a **star schema**.
- The fact table must store only:
  - `amount`
  - `quantity`
- Data must be **aggregated as necessary from the operational database before loading**.
- The grain is **daily sales** (not per order, not per orderline).

---

## Your Task

### Step 1: Design the Star Schema

Create a dimensional model that includes:

- One **fact table** (daily customer sales facts)
- Appropriate **dimension tables** (you decide which ones are necessary)

Your model must clearly show:

- Fact table name and fields
- Dimension table names and fields
- Primary keys and foreign keys
- Relationships (dimensions connect to the fact table)

---

## Deliverables

### 1) Star Schema Diagram (Required)

Create and submit a **diagram** of your star schema.

You may use any tool, such as:
- draw.io (diagrams.net)
- PowerPoint
- Google Drawings
- Lucidchart
- Hand-drawn on paper (then take a clear photo)

Save your diagram image in this repo and embed it below.

**File name suggestion:** `star-schema.png` or `star-schema.jpg`

### 2) Design Notes (Required)

In 1-2 short paragraphs, explain:

- What dimensions you chose and why
- Why your fact table grain is daily sales
- How your design supports at least 3 of the required analytics questions

#### Design Notes

The dimensions I chose were date, customer, and part. I feel that to answer the questions and not overdetail my model, this is sufficient. The date dimension allows the user to see not only the quarter the sale was made, but the month, day, and year. This allows the user to go into monthly sales and yearly sales if needed. The customer dimension not only allows us to see not only the zip code of the customer, but the state and city. Being from a small town with a hardware store that delivers parts on occasion, I feel it is important to understand where a customer might live within the zipcode if our store were to deliver something like a fridge or an oven. My part dimension allows us to see pieces like the part number (or SKU) within the store's system, where in the store it may be located, and how much it costs. This allows us to calculate aggregate functions like total sales (in both quantity and price) of this item. It also allows us to see how much of a certain section of the store's items are selling, which can allow us to further see where we need to put marketing tactics like discounts down the road. This all allows us to use the grain of daily sales to see trends of items and be "just detailed enough" to make better business judgements for the store's benefit.
